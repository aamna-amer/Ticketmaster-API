# TicketmasterR

`TicketmasterR` is an R wrapper package for the [Ticketmaster API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/)

> This API offers access to content from various platforms, including Ticketmaster, Universe, FrontGate Tickets, and Ticketmaster Resale (TMR), with events from all sources returned by default. With coverage of over 230k events across countries like the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other European nations, the API continuously adds more events and expands to additional countries. 

This R package implements the free Discovery API, providing functions to allow users to fetch and analyze event data, retrieve ticket prices, and visualize event trends.

Our package is available for installation. Please see Intro-TicketmasterR.html in the doc folder for how to get started.
