# Teamwork Contract and Contributions

### Time Commitment

Each group member is expected to contribute equally to the development and progression of the project. Since we acknowledge that individual schedules may vary, we respect if a member is unable to attend a meeting or lab session. In such cases, the absent member will be updated through alternative communication channels to ensure they remain informed and involved.

### Communication

Group members are expected to maintain regular communication regarding project progress, updates, and any questions that may arise. Communication can take place in-person during scheduled class or lab sessions, or through the designated Slack channel for remote discussions and real-time updates.

### Meetings

Group meetings will be scheduled as needed to discuss project updates, challenges, and next steps. Meeting minutes will not be formally documented - however, key points and action items will be communicated to all members to ensure alignment and progress.

### Contributions

Contribution to this project is limited to the internal contributors of this repository. All project-related activities, code, and documentation will be managed and contributed exclusively by the designated team members.
